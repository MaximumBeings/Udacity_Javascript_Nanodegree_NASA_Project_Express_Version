7. A description of the project per Udacity's website is here: 

Create a Mars Rover Dashboard

The functional JavaScript course project will be to build a dashboard for the past and current NASA Mars rovers, information about each mission and images from their excursions. You will be tasked with using all the ES6 syntax and functional programming concepts from the course to interact with a real NASA API and build the front end logic to create the dashboard.

8. Per requirement of the project, the implementation is supposed to use higher order functions. This project only used forEach to loop instead of using a for loop.

9. The project requires the use of immutable.js - this implementation did not use immutable.js because there was not really a need for it. However, the concept of copy and deepcopy is well understood by the author.

10. The project uses navigational links instead of forms to guide users choice of endpoints for aesthetic reasons.

(b) Udacity Intermediate Javascript Program videos and lectures
(c) Get Programming with Javascript - Manning Books
